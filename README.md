# minting-dapp-interface

A decentralized application (dApp) front end that interacts with an ERC1155-based smart contract for minting tokens and managing roles, using Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries. The interface will allow users to mint individual or batch tokens, set and remove roles, and update the base URI. The application will display tokens based on their IDs and amounts, and handle role-based access control. The backend functionality for direct blockchain interaction is not supported in this prototype but the front end will be designed to integrate with Ethereum blockchain.
